# Clozure CL

This is the source code for Clozure CL.

Because CCL is written in itself, you need an already-working version
of CCL to compile it.

See https://github.com/Clozure/ccl/releases/latest for instructions
on how to get a copy of CCL for your system.

To report a bug or request an enhancement, please make an issue at
https://github.com/Clozure/ccl/issues.

If you have questions or run into problems, send mail to
ccl-devel@clozure.com (see https://lists.clozure.com for instructions
on how to subscribe), ask on #ccl on libera.chat, or create an
issue here, especially if you think you have found a bug.
