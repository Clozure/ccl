# Clozure CL

This is the source code for Clozure CL.

Because CCL is written in itself, you need an already-working version
of CCL to compile it.

Please see https://github.com/Clozure/ccl/releases/latest and follow
the instructions to get a copy of CCL for your platform.

To report a bug or request an enhancement, please make an issue at
https://github.com/Clozure/ccl/issues.

If you run into problems, please send mail to
openmcl-devel@clozure.com, ask on #ccl on libera.chat, or create an
issue here, especially if you think you have found a bug.
