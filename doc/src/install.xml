      <para>&CCL; requires version 2.2.13 (or later) of the Linux
      kernel and version 2.1.3 (or later) of the GNU C library (glibc)
      at a bare minimum.</para>

      <para>
	Because of the nature of Linux distributions, it's difficult
	to give precise version number requirements.  In general, a
	"fairly modern" (no more than 2 or three years old) kernel and
	C library are more likely to work well than older
	versions.</para>

    <para>&CCL; should run on
    FreeBSD 6.x and 7.x.
    FreeBSD 7 users will need to install the "compat6x" package in order to use
    the distributed &CCL; kernel, which is built on a FreeBSD 6.x system.</para>

      versions will require at least 10.5.
      </para>

      <para>64-bit versions of &CCL; naturally require 64-bit processors
      (e.g., a G5 or Core 2 processor).  Some early Intel-based Macintoshes
      used processors that don't support
      64-bit operation, so the 64-bit &CCL; will not run on them, although
      the 32-bit &CCL; will.

  <!-- ============================================================ -->
  <sect1 id="obtaining-ccl"><title>Obtaining &CCL;</title>
    <para>There two main ways to obtain &CCL;.  For Mac OS X,
    there are disk images that can be used to install &CCL; in
    the usual Macintosh way. For other OSes, Subversion is the best
    way to obtain &CCL;.  Mac OS X users can also use Subversion
    if they prefer. Tarballs are available for those who prefer them,
    but if you have Subversion installed, it is simpler and more
    flexible to use Subversion than tarballs.
    </para>

    <para> There are three popular ways to use &CCL;: as a
      stand-alone double-clickable application (Mac OS X only), as a
      command-line application, or with EMACS and SLIME. The following
      sections describe these options.</para>

    <!-- ***************************************************** -->
    <sect2 id="obtaining-the-mac-way"><title>The Mac Way</title>
      <para>If you are using Mac OS X then you can install and use
         &CCL; in the usual Macintosh way.  Download and mount a
         disk image, then drag the ccl folder to the Applications folder
	 or wherever you wish.
         After that you can double-click the Clozure CL application found
	 inside the ccl directory.  The disk images are available at
         <ulink url="ftp://clozure.com/pub/release/1.4/"/> </para>

      <para>So that &CCL; can locate its source code, and for other
        reasons explained in
        <xref linkend="Predefined-Logical-Hosts"/>, you keep the
        Clozure CL application
        in the <literal>ccl</literal> directory.  If you use a shell,
        you can set the value of the
        <varname>CCL_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY</varname> environment variable
        to explicitly indicate the location of
        the <literal>ccl</literal> directory. If you choose to do
        that, then the <literal>ccl</literal> directory and the Clozure CL
        application can each be in any location you find
        convenient.</para>
    </sect2>
    

    <!-- ***************************************************** -->
    <sect2 id="obtaining-via-svn"><title>Getting &CCL; with Subversion</title>
      <para>It is very easy to download, install, and build &CCL;
      using Subversion. This is the preferred way to get either the
      latest, or a specific version of &CCL;, unless you prefer
      the Mac Way.  Subversion is a source code control system that is
      in wide use.  Many OSes come with Subversion
      pre-installed. A complete, buildable and runnable set of &CCL;
      sources and binaries can be retrieved with a single Subversion command.
      </para>

      <para>Day-to-day development of &CCL; takes place in an area
      of the Subversion repository known as the trunk.  At most times,
      the trunk is perfectly usable, but occasionally it can be unstable
      or totally broken.  If you wish to live on the 
      bleeding edge, the following command will fetch a copy of the trunk
      for Darwin x86 (both 32- and 64-bit versions):

        <para>These distributions contain complete sources and
        binaries. They use Subversion's "externals" features to share
        common sources; the majority of source code is the same across
        all versions.</para> 

        <para>Once the checkout is complete you can build &CCL; by
        running the lisp kernel and executing
        the <literal>rebuild-ccl</literal> function. For
        example:</para>

	<sect3 id="Checking-Subversion-Installation"><title>Checking Subversion Installation</title>
      <para>If <literal>svn co</literal> doesn't work, then make sure
      that Subversion is installed on your system.  Bring up a command
      line shell and type:
        <programlisting>
          <![CDATA[

        </programlisting> 
        If Subversion is installed, you will see something like:
        <programlisting>
          <![CDATA[
Type 'svn help' for usage]]>
        </programlisting>
        If Subversion is not installed, you will see something

        </programlisting>
        If Subversion is not installed, you'll need to figure out how
        to install it on your OS. You can find information about
        obtaining and installing Subversion at

      one on your local disk.  Then edit the &CCL; shell script to set
      the value of <varname>CCL_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY</varname> and start
      up the appropriate &CCL; kernel. See <xref

  <sect1 id="command-line-setup"><title>Command Line Set Up</title>
    <para>Sometimes it's convenient to use &CCL; from a Unix
      shell command line.  This is especially true when using &CCL;
      as a way to run Common Lisp utilities.</para>

    <!-- ***************************************************** -->
    <sect2 id="The-ccl-Shell-Script"><title>The ccl Shell Script</title>
      <para>&CCL; needs to be able to find the
        <literal>ccl</literal> directory in order to support features
        such as <literal>require</literal> and
        <literal>provide</literal>, access to foreign interface
        information (see <link linkend="The-Interface-Database">The
        Interface Database</link>) and the Lisp build process (see
        <link linkend="Building-CCL">Building &CCL; from its Source
        Code</link>). Specifically, it needs to set up logical
        pathname translations for the <literal>"ccl:"</literal>
        logical host.  If this logical host isn't defined (or isn't
        defined correctly), some things might work, some things might
        not, and it'll generally be hard to invoke and use &CCL;
        productively.</para>

      <para>&CCL; uses the value of the environment variable
        <literal>CCL_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY</literal> to determine the
        filesystem location of the <literal>ccl</literal> directory;
        the ccl shell script is intended to provide a way to
        invoke &CCL; with that environment variable set
        correctly.</para>
      <para>There are two versions of the shell script:
        <literal>"ccl/scripts/ccl"</literal> is used to invoke
        32-bit implementations of &CCL; and
        <literal>"ccl/scripts/ccl64"</literal> is used to invoke
        64-bit implementations.</para>
      <para>To use the script:</para>
      <orderedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>Copy the script to a directory that is on your
	  <varname>PATH</varname>.  This is often
	  <literal>/usr/local/bin</literal> or
	  <literal>~/bin</literal>.  It is better to do this than to
	  add <literal>ccl/scripts</literal> to your
	  <varname>PATH</varname>, because the script needs to be edited,
	  and editing it in-place means that Subversion sees the script as
	  modified..</para>
	</listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Edit the definition of
            <literal>CCL_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY</literal> near the
            beginning of the shell script so that it refers to
            your <literal>ccl</literal> directory.  Alternately, set
            the value of the <literal>CCL_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY</literal>
            environment variable in your .cshrc, .tcshrc,
            .bashrc,.bash_profile, .MacOSX/environment.plist, or
            wherever you usually set environment variables.  If there
            is an existing definition of the variable, the ccl
            script will not override it.

        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Ensure that the shell script is executable, for
            example:</para>

          <para>This command grants execute permission to the named
            script. If you are using a 32-bit platform, substitute
            "ccl" in place of "ccl64".
            <warning>
	          <para>The above command won't work if you are not the
	            owner of the installed copy of &CCL;. In that case,
	            you can use the "sudo" command like this:</para>
              <para><literal>$ sudo chmod +x
                  ~/ccl/ccl/scripts/ccl64</literal></para>
              <para>Give your password when prompted.</para>
              <para>If the "sudo" command doesn't work, then you are
                not an administrator on the system you're using, and you
                don't have the appropriate "sudo" permissions. In that
                case you'll need to get help from the system's
                administrator.</para>
          </warning></para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>

      <para>Note that most people won't need both
      <literal>ccl</literal> and <literal>ccl64</literal> scripts.
      You only need both if you sometimes run 32-bit &CCL; and
      sometimes run 64-bit &CCL;.  You can rename the script that
      you use to whatever you want.  For example, if you are on a
      64-bit system, and you only use &CCL; in 64-bit mode, then
      you can rename  <literal>ccl64</literal> to
      <literal>ccl</literal> so that you only need to type
      "<literal>ccl</literal>" to run it.</para>

      <para>Once this is done, it should be possible to invoke &CCL;
        by typing <literal>ccl</literal>
        or <literal>ccl64</literal> at a shell prompt:</para>

      <para>The ccl shell script passes all of its arguments to the
      &CCL; kernel.  See <xref linkend="Invocation"/> for more
      information about these arguments.  When invoked this way, the
      Lisp should be able to initialize the <literal>"ccl:"</literal>
      logical host so that its translations refer to the
      <literal>"ccl"</literal> directory. To test this, you can call
      <literal>probe-file</literal> in &CCL;'s read-eval-print
      loop:</para>

    <title>Using &CCL; with GNU Emacs and SLIME</title>
    <para>A very common way to use &CCL; is to run it within the
      GNU Emacs editor, using a Lisp interface called SLIME ("Superior
      Lisp Interaction Mode for Emacs"). SLIME is an Emacs package
      designed to provide good support within Emacs for any of several
      Common Lisp implementations; one of the supported
      implementations is &CCL;. This page describes how you can
      download SLIME and set it up to work with your &CCL;
      installation.</para>
    <para>Why use SLIME? With SLIME, you can do the following things from within
      an Emacs editing session:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
	      <para>You have a working installation of GNU Emacs. If you

	        Emacs</ulink>.  If you prefer to use XEmacs instead of GNU
	        Emacs, these instructions should still work; SLIME supports
	        XEmacs Version21. Mac OS X includes an Emacs installation.
	        If you want to look into different versions, you can check
	        out theEmacsWiki, which maintains a

            customizations meant to make it behave more like a
            standard Macintosh application, with windows, a menubar,
            etc.  Aquamacs includes SLIME; if you like Aquamacs then
            you can use SLIME right away, without getting and
            installing it separately. You just need to tell SLIME

    <sect2 id="Getting_Slime"><title>Getting SLIME</title>       

      <para>You can get SLIME from the SLIME Home Page. Stable
        releases and CVS snapshots are available as archive files, or
        you can follow the instructions on the SLIME Home Page to
        check out the latest version from their CVS repository.</para>

      <para>It's worth noting that stable SLIME releases happen very
        seldom, but the SLIME developers often make changes and
        improvements that are available through CVS updates. If you
        asked the SLIM developers, they would most likely recommend
        that you get SLIME from their CVS repository and update it
        frequently.</para>

      <para>Whether you get it from CVS, or download and unpack one
        of the available archives, you should end up with a folder
        named "slime" that contains the SLIME distribution.</para>

    <sect2 id="installing-slime"><title>Installing SLIME</title> 

      <para>Once you have the "slime" folder described in the previous
        section, installation is a simple matter of copying the folder
        to the proper place. You can drag it into the "~/emacs/site/"
        folder, or you can use a terminal command to copy it
        there. For example, assuming your working directory contains
        the unpacked "slime" folder:</para> <para><literal>$ cp -R

	  <para>Sometimes you'll get a new version of &CCL;, set up

	    what has happened is that the new version of &CCL; has a

	    developers will say "the fasl version has changed." fasl
	    stands for "fast load" aka compiled files). This
	    problem is easy to fix: just delete the existing SLIME fasl
	    files. The next time you launch Emacs and start SLIME, it will
	    automatically recompile the Lisp files, and that should fix
	    the problem.</para>
      <para>SLIME's load process stores its fasl files in a hidden

	    The leading "." character in the ".slime" folder's name
