      <title>Overview</title>
      <para>&CCL; provides a fairly rich language for defining and
        specifying foreign data types (this language is derived from
        CMUCL's "alien type" system.)</para>
      <para>In practice, most foreign type definitions are
        introduced into &CCL; via its interface database (see ),
        though it's also possible to define foreign types
        interactively and/or programmatically.</para>
      <para>&CCL;'s foreign type system is "evolving" (a polite word
        for not-quite-complete): there are some inconsistencies
        involving package usage, for instance. Symbols used in foreign
        type specifiers <emphasis>should</emphasis> be keywords, but
        this convention isn't always enforced.</para> <para>Foreign
        type, record, and field names are case-sensitive; &CCL; uses
        some escaping conventions (see ) to allow keywords to be used to
        denote these names.</para>

      <sect3 id="type annotations">
        <title>Type Annotations</title>
        <para>As of version 1.2, &CCL; supports annotating the types of
          foreign pointers on Mac OS X. Forms that create pointers to
          foreign memory&mdash;that is, <code>MACPTR</code>s&mdash;store
          with the <code>MACPTR</code> object a type annotation that
          identifies the foreign type of the object pointed
          to. Calling <code>PRINT-OBJECT</code> on a <code>MACPTR</code>
          attempts to print information about the identified foreign
          type, including whether it was allocated on the heap or the
          stack, and whether it's scheduled for automatic reclamation by
          the garbage collector.</para>

        <para>Support for type annotation is not yet complete. In
          particular, some uses of <code>PREF</code>
          and <code>SLOT-VALUE</code> do ot yet take type annotations into
          account, and neither do <code>DESCRIBE</code>
          and <code>INSPECT</code>.</para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3 id="foreign-type-classes">
        <title>Foreign Types as Classes</title>
        <para>Some types of foreign pointers take advantage of the
          support for type annotations, and pointers of these types
          can be treated as instances of known classes. Specifically,
          a pointer to an <code>:&lt;NSR&gt;ect</code> is recognized
          as an instance of the built-in
          class <code>NS:NS-RECT</code>, a pointer to
          an <code>&lt;NSS&gt;ize</code> is treated as an instance
          of <code>NS:NS-SIZE</code>, a pointer to
          an <code>&lt;NSP&gt;oint</code> is recognized as an
          instance of <code>NS:NS-POINT</code>, and a pointer to
          an <code>&lt;NSR&gt;ange</code> is recognized as an
          instance of <code>NS:NS-RANGE</code>.</para>

        <para>A few more obscure structure types also support this
        mechanism, and it's possible that a future version will
        support user definition of similar type mappings.</para>

        <para>This support for foreign types as classes provides the
        following conveniences for each supported type:</para>

        <listitem>
          <para>a foreign type name is created and treated as an alias
          for the corresponding type. As an example, the
          name <code>:NS-RECT</code> is a name for the type that
          corresponds to <code>NS:NS-RECT</code>, and you can
          use <code>:NS-RECT</code> as a type designator
          in <link linkend="anchor_rlet"><code>RLET</code></link> forms to

        <listitem>
          <para>inlined accessor and <code>SETF</code> inverses are

            <code>NS-RECT-HEIGHT</code> and <code>SETF</code> inverses
            are defined.  The accessors and setter functions typecheck
            their arguments and the setters handle coercion to the

      <para>&CCL; provides a number of constructs for calling
        foreign functions from Lisp code (all of them based on the
        function CCL:%FF-CALL).  In many cases, &CCL;'s interface
        translator (see ) provides information about the foreign
        function's entrypoint name and argument and return types; this
        enables the use of the #_ reader macro (described below),
        which may be more concise and/or more readable than other
        constructs.</para>
      <para>&CCL; also provides a mechanism for defining
        <emphasis>callbacks</emphasis>: lisp functions which can be
        called from foreign code.</para>
      <para>There's no supported way to directly pass lisp data to
        foreign functions: scalar lisp data must be coerced to an
        equivalent foreign representation, and lisp arrays (notably

	      Binary Interface (ABI) of the platform; unless you're

	    <title>External Entrypoints and Named External Entrypoints</title>
        <para>PowerPC machine instructions are always aligned on
          32-bit boundaries, so the two least significant bits of the
          first instruction ("entrypoint") of a foreign function are
          always 0. &CCL; often represents an entrypoint address as
          a fixnum that's binary-equivalent to the entrypoint address:
          if<emphasis> E</emphasis> is an entrypoint address expressed
          as a signed 32-bit integer, then (ash <emphasis>E</emphasis>
          -2) is an equivalent fixnum representation of that
          address. An entrypoint address can also be encapsulated in a
          MACPTR (see FIXTHIS), but that's somewhat less efficient.</para>
        <para>Although it's possible to use fixnums or macptrs to
          represent entrypoint addresses, it's somewhat cumbersome to
          do so. &CCL; can cache the addresses of named external
          functions in structure-like objects of type
          CCL:EXTERNAL-ENTRY-POINT (sometimes abbreviated as EEP).
          Through the use of LOAD-TIME-VALUE, compiled lisp functions
          are able to reference EEPs as constants; the use of an
          indirection allows &CCL; runtime system to ensure that the

	    <title>Basics</title>
        <para>For a variety of technical reasons, it isn't generally
          possible to directly reference arbitrary absolute addresses
          (such as those returned by the C library function malloc(),
          for instance) in &CCL;. In &CCL; (and in MCL), such
          addresses need to be <emphasis>encapsulated</emphasis> in
          objects of type CCL:MACPTR; one can think of a MACPTR as
          being a specialized type of structure whose sole purpose is
          to provide a way of referring to an underlying "raw"
          address.</para>
        <para>It's sometimes convenient to blur the distinction
          between a MACPTR and the address it represents; it's
          sometimes necessary to maintain that distinction. It's
          important to remember that a MACPTR is (generally) a
          first-class Lisp object in the same sense that a CONS cell
          is: it'll get GCed when it's no longer possible to reference
          it. The "lifetime" of a MACPTR doesn't generally have
          anything to do with the lifetime of the block of memory its
          address points to.</para>
        <para>It might be tempting to ask "How does one obtain the
          address encapsulated by a MACPTR ?". The answer to that
          question is that one doesn't do that (and there's no way to
          do that): addresses aren't first-class objects, and there's
          no way to refer to one.</para>
        <para>Two MACPTRs that encapsulate the same address are EQL
          to each other.</para>
        <para>There are a small number of ways to directly create a
          MACPTR (and there's a fair amount of syntactic sugar built
          on top of of those primitives.) These primitives will be
          discussed in greater detail below, but they include:</para>

	    <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
	        <para>Creating a MACPTR with a specified address, usually

	          contain an address.</para>
	      </listitem>
	    </itemizedlist>

        <para>All of these primitive MACPTR-creating operations are
          usually open-coded by the compiler; it has a fairly good
          notion of what low-level operations "produce" MACPTRs and
          which operations "consume" the addresses that the
          encapsulate, and will usually optimize out the introduction
          of intermediate MACPTRs in a simple expression.</para>
        <para>One consequence of the use of MACPTR objects to
          encapsulate foreign addresses is that (naively)
          <emphasis>every reference to a foreign address causes a
            MACPTR to be allocated.</emphasis></para>
        <para>Consider a code fragment like the following:</para>
        <programlisting>
(defun get-next-event ()
  "get the next event from a hypothetical window system"
  (loop
     (let* ((event (#_get_next_window_system_event))) ; via an FF-CALL
       (unless (null-event-p event)
         (handle-event event)))))
        </programlisting>
        <para>As this is written, each call to the (hypothetical)
          foreign function #_get_next_window_system_event will return
          a new MACPTR object.  Ignoring for the sake of argument the
          question of whether this code fragment exhibits a good way
          to poll for external events (it doesn't), it's not hard to
          imagine that this loop could execute several million times
          per second (producing several million MACPTRs per second.)
          Clearly, the "naive" approach is impractical in many
          cases.</para>

      <sect3 id="Stack-allocation-of---and-destructive-operations-on---MACPTRs-">
        <title>Stack allocation of&mdash;and destructive operations on&mdash;MACPTRs.</title>
	    <para>If certain conditions held in the environment in which
	      GET-NEXT-EVENT ran&mdash;namely, if it was guaranteed that
	      neither NULL-EVENT-P nor HANDLE-EVENT cached or otherwise
	      retained their arguments (the "event" pointer)&mdash;there'd be
	      a few alternatives to the naive approach. One of those
	      approaches would be to use the primitive function
	      %SETF-MACPTR (described in greater detail below) to
	      destructively modify a MACPTR (to change the value of the
	      address it encapsulates.) The GET-NEXT-EVENT example could
	      be re-written as:</para>
        <programlisting>
(defun get-next-event ()
  (let* ((event (%int-to-ptr 0)))     ; create a MACPTR with address 0
    (loop
       (%setf-macptr event (#_get_next_window_system_event)) ; re-use it
       (unless (null-event-p event)
         (handle-event event)))))
        </programlisting>
        <para>That version's a bit more realistic: it allocates a
          single MACPTR outside if the loop, then changes its address
          to point to the current address of the hypothetical event
          structure on each loop iteration. If there are a million
          loop iterations per call to GET-NEXT-EVENT, we're allocating
          a million times fewer MACPTRs per call; that sounds like a
          Good Thing.</para>
        <para>An Even Better Thing would be to advise the compiler
          that the initial value (the null MACPTR) bound to the
          variable event has dynamic extent (that value won't be
          referenced once control leaves the extent of the binding of
          that variable.) Common Lisp allows us to make such an
          assertion via a DYNAMIC-EXTENT declaration; &CCL;'s
          compiler can recognize the "primitive MACPTR-creating
          operation" involved and can replace it with an equivalent
          operation that stack-allocates the MACPTR object. If we're
          not worried about the cost of allocating that MACPTR on
          every iteration (the cost is small and there's no hidden GC
          cost), we could move the binding back inside the
          loop:</para>
        <programlisting>
(defun get-next-event ()
  (loop
     (let* ((event (%null-ptr))) ; (%NULL-PTR) is shorthand for (%INT-TO-PTR 0)
       (declare (dynamic-extent event))
       (%setf-macptr event (#_get_next_window_system_event))
       (unless (null-event-p event)
         (handle-event event)))))
        </programlisting>
        <para>The idiom of binding one or more variables to
          stack-allocated MACPTRs, then destructively modifying those
          MACPTRs before executing a body of code is common enough
          that &CCL; provides a macro (WITH-MACPTRS) that handles
          all of the gory details. The following version of
          GET-NEXT-EVENT is semantically equivalent to the previous
          version, but hopefully a bit more concise:</para>
        <programlisting>
(defun get-next-event ()
  (loop
     (with-macptrs ((event (#_get_next_window_system_event)))
       (unless (null-event-p event)
         (handle-event event)))))

        <title>Stack-allocated memory (and stack-allocated pointers to it.)</title>
	    <para>Fairly often, the blocks of foreign memory (obtained
	      by malloc or something similar) have well-defined lifetimes
	      (they can safely be freed at some point when it's known that
	      they're no longer needed and it's known that they're no
	      longer referenced.) A common idiom might be:</para>
        <programlisting>
(with-macptrs (p (#_allocate_foreign_memory size))
  (unwind-protect
       (use-foreign-memory p)
    (#_deallocate_foreign_memory p)))
        </programlisting>
        <para>That's not unreasonable code, but it's fairly
          expensive for a number of reasons: foreign functions calls
          are themselves fairly expensive (as is UNWIND-PROTECT), and
          most library routines for allocating and deallocating
          foreign memory (things like malloc and free) can be fairly
          expensive in their own right.</para>
        <para>In the idiomatic code above, both the MACPTR P and the
          block of memory that's being allocated and freed have
          dynamic extent and are therefore good candidates for stack
          allocation. &CCL; provides the %STACK-BLOCK macro, which
          executes a body of code with one or more variables bound to
          stack-allocated MACPTRs which encapsulate the addresses of
          stack-allocated blocks of foreign memory. Using
          %STACK-BLOCK, the idiomatic code is:</para>
        <programlisting>
(%stack-block ((p size))
              (use-foreign-memory p))
        </programlisting>
        <para>which is a bit more efficient and a bit more concise
          than the version presented earlier.</para>
        <para>%STACK-BLOCK is used as the basis for slightly
          higher-level things like RLET. (See FIXTHIS for more information
          about RLET.)</para>

        <para>Reading from, writing to, allocating, and freeing

          this is no less true when these operations are performed in

          lower-level language. In addition, destructive operations on

          abused (if DYNAMIC-EXTENT declarations are violated.)

      <para>&CCL; uses a set of database files which contain
        foreign type, record, constant, and function definitions
        derived from the operating system's header files, be that
        Linux or Darwin.  An archive containing these database files
        (and the shell scripts which were used in their creation) is
        available; see the Distributions page for information about
        obtaining current interface database files.</para>
      <para>Not surprisingly, different platforms use different database files.</para>
      <para>&CCL; defines reader macros that consult these databases:</para>
	  <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
	      <para>#$foo looks up the value of the constant definition of foo</para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>#_foo looks up the foreign function definition for foo</para>
	    </listitem>
        
      </itemizedlist>
      <para>In both cases, the symbol foo is interned in the "OS"
        package. The #$ reader macro has the side-effect of defining
        foo as a constant (as if via DEFCONSTANT); the #_ reader macro
        has the side effect of defining foo as a macro which will
        expand into an (EXTERNAL-CALL form.)</para>
      <para>It's important to remember that the side-effect happens
        when the form containing the reader macro is
        read. Macroexpansion functions that expand into forms which
        contain instances of those reader macros don't do what one
        might think that they do, unless the macros are expanded in
        the same lisp session as the reader macro was read in.</para>
      <para>In addition, references to foreign type,
        structure/union, and field names (when used in the RREF/PREF
        and RLET macros) will cause these database files to be
        consulted.</para>
      <para>Since the &CCL; sources contain instances of these
        reader macros (and references to foreign record types and
        fields), compiling &CCL; from those sources depends on the
        ability to find and use (see <xref

      <para>e.g, as a set of parallel subdirectories, each with a
        lowercase name and each of which contains a set of 6 database
        files and a "C" subdirectory which contains a shell script
        used in the database creation process.</para>
      <para>As one might assume, the database files in each of these
        subdirectories contain foreign type, constant, and function
        definitions - as well as Objective-C class and method info -that
        correspond (roughly) to the information contained in the
        header files associated with a "-dev" package in a Linux
        distribution.  "libc" corresponds pretty closely to the
        interfaces associated with "glibc/libc6" header files, "gl"
        corresponds to an "openGL+GLUT" development package, "gtk"
        and "gnome" contain interface information from the GTK+1.2 and
        GNOME libraries, respectively.</para>
      <para>For Darwin, the "ccl:darwin-headers" directory contains
        a "libc" subdirectory, whose contents roughly correspond to
        those of "/usr/include" under Darwin, as well as
        subdirectories corresponding to the MacOSX Carbon and Cocoa
        frameworks.</para>
      <para>To see the precise set of .h files used to generate the
        database files in a given interface directory, consult the
        corresponding "populate.sh" shell script (in the interface
        directory's "C" subdirectory.)</para>
      <para>The intent is that this initial set can be augmented to
        meet local needs, and that this can be done in a fairly
        incremental fashion: one needn't have unrelated header files
        installed in order to generate interface databases for a
        package of interest.</para>
      <para>Hopefully, this scheme will also make it easier to
        distribute patches and bug fixes.</para>
      <para>&CCL; maintains a list of directories; when looking
        for a foreign type, constant, function, or record definition,
        it'll consult the database files in each directory on that
        list. Initially, the list contains an entry for the "libc"
        interface directory. &CCL; needs to be explicitly told to
        look in other interface directories should it need to do
        so.</para>

        EXTERNAL-ENTRY-POINT must be in the resolved state in order to
        be FF-CALLed; calling an unresolved entry point causes a "last
        chance" attempt to resolve it. Attempting to resolve an

    <sect2 id="Interface-translator-overview">
	  <title>Overview</title>
	  <para>&CCL; uses an interface translation system based on the FFIGEN
	    system, which is described at
	    http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/lth/ffigen/.
	    The interface translator makes
	    the constant, type, structure, and function definitions in a set of
	    C-language header files available to lisp code.</para>
      <para>The basic idea of the FFIGEN scheme is to use the C
        compiler's frontend and parser to translate .h files into
        semantically equivalent .ffi files, which represent the
        definitions from the headers using a syntax based on
        S-expressions.  Lisp code can then concentrate on the .ffi
        representation, without having to concern itself with the
        semantics of header file inclusion or the arcana of C
        parsing.</para>
      <para>The original FFIGEN system used a modified version of
        the LCC C compiler to produce .ffi files. Since many LinuxPPC
        header files contain GCC-specific constructs, &CCL;'s
        translation system uses a modified version of GCC (called,
        somewhat confusingly, ffigen.)</para>
      <para>A version of ffigen based on GCC-4.0 was developed
        during the spring and summer of 2005.  Sources (diffs relative
        to the GCC-4.0 release) are available here, and binaries are
        available for DarwinPPC and for LinuxPPC.  These versions
        should be insensitive to to the version of GCC (and its
        preprocessor) installed on the system.</para>
      <para>An older version was developed in 2001-2002; it depended
        on the installed version of GCC being 2.95.  It may still be
        of interest for people unable to run the GCC-4.0-based version
        for whatever reason.</para>
      <para>A LinuxPPC binary of this older version is available at
        ftp://clozure.com/pub/ffigen-0.1.tar.gz, and LinuxPPC source
        differences are at

        differences are at

      <para>A shell script (distributed with the source and binary
        packages) called h-to-ffi.sh reads a specified .h file (and
        optional preprocessor arguments) and writes a (hopefully)

        ("ccl:darwin-headers;<emphasis>subdir</emphasis>;C;populate.sh"
        for Darwin)) calls h-to-ffi.sh on a large number of the header
        files in /usr/include (or some other <emphasis>system header

    <sect2 id="Case-sensitivity-overview">
	  <title>Overview</title>
	  <para>As of release 0.11, &CCL; addresses the fact that
	    foreign type, constant, record, field, and function nams are
	    case-sensitive and provides mechanisms to refer to these names
	    via lisp symbols.</para>
      <para>Previous versions of &CCL; have tried to ignore that
        fact, under the belief that case conflicts were rare and that
        many users (and implementors) would prefer not to deal with
        case-related issues. The fact that some information in the
        interface databases was incomplete or inaccessible because of
        this policy made it clearer that the policy was untenable. I
        can't claim that the approach described here is aesthetically
        pleasing, but I can honestly say that it's less unpleasant
        than other approaches that I'd thought of. I'd be interested
        to hear alternate proposals.</para>
      <para>The issues described here have to do with how lisp
        symbols are used to denote foreign functions, constants,
        types, records, and fields. It doesn't affect how other lisp
        objects are sometimes used to denote foreign objects. For
        instance, the first argument to the EXTERNAL-CALL macros is
        now and has always been a case-sensitive string.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="Foreign-constant-and-function-names">
	  <title>Foreign constant and function names</title>
      <para>The primary way of referring to foreign constant and
        function names in &CCL; is via the #$ and #_ reader
        macros. These reader macro functions each read a symbol into
        the "OS" package, look up its constant or function definition
        in the interface database, and assign the value of the
        constant to the symbol or install a macroexpansion function on
        the symbol.</para>
      <para>In order to observe case-sensitivity, the reader-macros
        now read the symbol with (READTABLE-CASE :PRESERVE) in
        effect.</para>
      <para>This means that it's necessary to type the foreign
        constant or function name in correct case, but it isn't
        necessary to use any special escaping constructs when writing
        the variable name. For instance:</para>
      <programlisting>
        (#_read fd buf n) ; refers to foreign symbol "read"
        (#_READ fd buf n) ; refers to foreign symbol "READ", which may
        ; not exist ...
        #$o_rdonly ; Probably doesn't exist
        #$O_RDONLY ; Exists on most platforms
      </programlisting>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="Foreign-type--record--and-field-names">
	  <title>Foreign type, record, and field names</title>
	  <para>Constructs like RLET expect a foreign type or record
	    name to be denoted by a symbol (typically a keyword); RREF
	    (and PREF) expect an "accessor" form, typically a keyword
	    formed by concatenating a foreign type or record name with a
	    sequence of one or more foreign field names, separated by
	    dots. These names are interned by the reader as other lisp
	    symbols are, with an arbitrary value of READTABLE-CASE in
	    effect (typically :UPCASE.) It seems like it would be very
	    tedious to force users to manually escape (via vertical bar or
	    backslash syntax) all lowercase characters in symbols used to
	    specify foreign type, record, and field names (especially
	    given that many traditional POSIX structure, type, and field
	    names are entirely lowercase.)</para>
      <para>The approach taken by &CCL; is to allow the symbols
        (keywords) used to denote foreign type, record, and field
        names to contain angle brackets (<literal>&lt;</literal> and
        <literal>&gt;</literal>). Such symbols are translated to
	    foreign names via the following set of conventions:</para>
	  <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
	      <para>All instances of &lt; and &gt; in the symbol's pname
	        are balanced and don't nest.</para>
	    </listitem>
        <listitem>
	      <para>Any alphabetic characters in the symbol's pname
	        that aren't enclosed in angle brackets are treated as
	        lower-case,regardless of the value of READTABLE-CASE and
	        regardless of the case in which they were written.</para>
	    </listitem>
        <listitem>
	      <para>Alphabetic characters that appear within angle
	        brackets are mapped to upper-case, again regardless of how
	        they were written or interned.</para>
	    </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
	  <para>There may be many ways of "escaping" (with angle
	    brackets) sequences of upper-case and non-lower-case
	    characters in a symbol used to denote a foreign name. When
	    translating in the other direction, &CCL; always escapes the
	    longest sequence that starts with an upper-case character and
	    doesn't contain a lower-case character.</para>
      <para>It's often preferable to use this canonical form of a
        foreign type name.</para>
      <para>The accessor forms used by PREF/RREF should be viewed as
        a series of foreign type/record and field names; upper-case
        sequences in the component names should be escaped with angle
        brackets, but those sequences shouldn't span components. (More
        simply, the separating dots shouldn't be enclosed, even if
        both surrounding characters need to be.)</para>
      <para>Older POSIX code tends to use lower-case exclusively for
        type, record, and field names; there are only a few cases in
        the &CCL; sources where mixed-case names need to be
        escaped.</para>

  <sect1 id="Reading-Foreign-Names">
    <title>Reading Foreign Names</title> <para>Clozure Common Lisp
      provides several reader macros to make it more convenient to
      handle foreign type, function, variable, and constant
      names. Each of these reader macros reads symbols preserving the
      case of the source text, and selects an appropriate package in
      which to intern the resulting symbol. These reader macros are
      especially useful when your Lisp code interacts extensively with
      a foreign library&mdash;for example, when using Mac OS X's Cocoa
      frameworks.</para>

    <para>These reader macros include "#_" to read foreign function
      names, "#&amp;" to read foreign variable names (note that in
      earlier versions of OpenMCL the reader macro "#?" was used for
      this same purpose), "#$" to read foreign constant names, "#/" to
      read the names of foreign Objective-C methods, and "#>" to read
      keywords that can be used as the names of types, records, and
      accessors.</para>

    <para>All of these reader macros preserve the case of the text
      that they read; beyond that similarity, each performs some
      additional work, unique to each reader macro, to create symbols
      suitable for a particular use. For example, the function,
      variable, and constant reader macros intern the resulting symbol
      in the "OS" package of the running platform, but the reader
      macro for Objective-C method names interns symbols in the
      "NEXTSTEP-FUNCTIONS" package.</para>

    <para>You are likely to see these reader macros used extensively
      in Lisp code that works with foreign libraries; for example,
      &CCL; IDE code, which defines numerous Objective-C classes
      and methods, uses these reader macros extensively.</para>

    <para>This defines three functions.  If you're familiar with C,
      notice that there's no <literal>main()</literal>, because we're
      just building a library, not an executable.</para>
    <para>The function <literal>void_void_test()</literal> doesn't
      take any parameters, and doesn't return anything, but it prints
      two lines to let us know it was called.
      <literal>sc_sc_test()</literal> takes a signed char as a
      parameter, prints it, and returns it.
      <literal>uc_uc_test()</literal> does the same thing, but with an
      unsigned char.  Their purpose is just to prove to us that we
      really can call C functions, pass them values, and get values
      back from them.</para>
    <para>This code is compiled into a dynamic library on OS X
      10.3.4 with the command:</para>
    <programlisting>

      gcc -dynamiclib -Wall -o libtypetest.dylib typetest.c \
      -install_name ./libtypetest.dylib
    </programlisting>
    <tip><para>Users of 64-bit platforms may need to pass options such
        as "-m64" to gcc, may need to give the output library a different
        extension (such as ".so"), and may need to user slightly different
        values for other options in order to create an equivalent test
        library.</para></tip>

    <para>The -dynamiclib tells gcc that we will be compiling this
      into a dynamic library and not an executable binary program.
      The output filename is "libtypetest.dylib".  Notice that we
      chose a name which follows the normal OS X convention, being in
      the form "libXXXXX.dylib", so that other programs can link to
      the library.  &CCL; doesn't need it to be this way, but it is
      a good idea to adhere to existing conventions.</para>
    <para>The -install_name flag is primarily used when building OS
      X "bundles".  In this case, we are not using it, so we put a
      placeholder into it, "./libtypetest.dylib".  If we wanted to use
      typetest in a bundle, the -install_name argument would be a
      relative path from some "current" directory.</para>
    <para>After creating this library, the first step is to tell
      &CCL; to open the dynamic library.  This is done by calling
      .</para>
    <programlisting>

      Welcome to &CCL; Version (Beta: Darwin) 0.14.2-040506!

      ? (open-shared-library "/Users/andewl/openmcl/libtypetest.dylib")
      #&lt;SHLIB /Users/andewl/openmcl/libtypetest.dylib #x638EF3E&gt;
    </programlisting>
    <para>You should use an absolute path here; using a relative
      one, such as just "libtypetest.dylib", would appear to work, but
      there are subtle problems which occur after reloading it.  See
      the Darwin notes on for details.  It would be a bad idea anyway,
      because software should never rely on its starting directory
      being anything in particular.</para>
    <para>This command returns a reference to the opened shared library, and
      &CCL; also adds one to the global variable
      <literal>ccl::*shared-libraries*</literal>:</para>
    <programlisting>

       #&lt;SHLIB /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib #x606179E>)
    </programlisting>
    <para>Before we call anything, let's check that the individual
      functions can actually be found by the system.  We don't have to
      do this, but it helps to know how to find out whether this is
      the problem, when something goes wrong.  We use <xref
                                                         linkend="m_external-call"/>:</para>
    <programlisting>

      ? (external "_void_void_test")
      #&lt;EXTERNAL-ENTRY-POINT "_void_void_test" (#x000CFDF8) /Users/andewl/openmcl/libtypetest.dylib #x638EDF6>

      ? (external "_sc_sc_test")
      #&lt;EXTERNAL-ENTRY-POINT "_sc_sc_test" (#x000CFE50) /Users/andewl/openmcl/libtypetest.dylib #x638EB3E>

    </programlisting>
    <para>Notice that the actual function names have been "mangled"
      by the C linker.  The first function was named "void_void_test"
      in typetest.c, but in libtypetest.dylib, it has an underscore (a
      "_" symbol) before it: "_void_void_test".  So, this is the name
      which you have to use.  The mangling - the way the name is
      changed - may be different for other operating systems or other
      versions, so you need to "just know" how it's done...</para>
    <para>Also, pay particular attention to the fact that a
      hexadecimal value appears in the EXTERNAL-ENTRY-POINT.
      (#x000CFDF8, for example - but what it is doesn't matter.)
      These hex numbers mean that the function can be dereferenced.
      Functions which aren't found will not have a hex number.  For
      example:</para>
    <programlisting>

      ? (external "functiondoesnotexist")
      #&lt;EXTERNAL-ENTRY-POINT "functiondoesnotexist" {unresolved}  #x638E3F6>
    </programlisting>
    <para>The "unresolved" tells us that &CCL; wasn't able to find this
      function, which means you would get an error, "Can't resolve foreign
      symbol," if you tried to call it.</para>
    <para>These external function references also are stored in a
      hash table which is accessible through a global variable,
      <literal>ccl::*eeps*</literal>.</para>
    <para>At this point, we are ready to try our first external
      function call:</para>
    <programlisting>

      ? (external-call "_void_void_test" :void)
      Entered void_void_test:
      Exited  void_void_test:
      NIL
    </programlisting>
    <para>We used , which is is the normal mechanism for accessing
      externally linked code.  The "_void_void_test" is the mangled
      name of the external function.  The :void refers to the return
      type of the function.</para>
    <para>The next step is to try passing a value to C, and getting one
      back:</para>
    <programlisting>

      ? (external-call "_sc_sc_test" :signed-byte -128 :signed-byte)
      Entered sc_sc_test:
      Data In: -128
      Exited  sc_sc_test:
      -128
    </programlisting>
    <para>The first :signed-byte gives the type of the first
      argument, and then -128 gives the value to pass for it.  The
      second :signed-byte gives the return type.  The return type is
      always given by the last argument to .</para>
    <para>Everything looks good.  Now, let's try a number outside
      the range which fits in one byte:</para>
    <programlisting>

      ? (external-call "_sc_sc_test" :signed-byte -567 :signed-byte)
      Entered sc_sc_test:
      Data In: -55
      Exited  sc_sc_test:
      -55
    </programlisting>
    <para>Hmmmm.  A little odd.  Let's look at the unsigned stuff to
      see how it reacts:</para>
    <programlisting>

      ? (external-call "_uc_uc_test" :unsigned-byte 255 :unsigned-byte)
      Entered uc_uc_test:
      Data In: 255
      Exited  uc_uc_test:
      255
    </programlisting>
    <para>That looks okay.  Now, let's go outside the valid range again:</para>
    <programlisting>

      ? (external-call "_uc_uc_test" :unsigned-byte 567 :unsigned-byte)
      Entered uc_uc_test:
      Data In: 55
      Exited  uc_uc_test:
      55

      ? (external-call "_uc_uc_test" :unsigned-byte -567 :unsigned-byte)
      Entered uc_uc_test:
      Data In: 201
      Exited  uc_uc_test:
      201
    </programlisting>
    <para>Since a signed byte can only hold values from -128 through 127, and
      an unsigned one can only hold values from 0 through 255, any number
      outside that range gets "clipped": only the low eight bits of it
      are used.</para>
    <para>What is important to remember is that <emphasis>external
        function calls have
        very few safety checks.</emphasis>
      Data outside the valid range for its type will silently do
      very strange things; pointers outside the valid range can very well
      crash the system.</para>
    <para>That's it for our first example library.  If you're still
      following along, let's add some more C code to look at the rest
      of the primitive types.  Then we'll need to recompile the
      dynamic library, load it again, and then we can see what
      happens.</para>
    <para>Add the following code to typetest.c:</para>
    <programlisting>
int
si_si_test(int data)
{
    printf("Entered %s:\n", __FUNCTION__);
    printf("Data In: %d\n", data);
    printf("Exited  %s:\n", __FUNCTION__);
    fflush(stdout);
    return data;
}

{

{

    printf("Data In: %e\n", data);
    printf("Exited  %s:\n", __FUNCTION__);
    fflush(stdout);
    return data;
}

double

{
    printf("Entered %s:\n", __FUNCTION__);
    printf("Data In: %e\n", data);
    printf("Exited  %s:\n", __FUNCTION__);
    fflush(stdout);
    return data;
}
    </programlisting>
    <para>The command line to compile the dynamic library is the same as before:</para>
    <programlisting>

      gcc -dynamiclib -Wall -o libtypetest.dylib typetest.c \
      -install_name ./libtypetest.dylib
    </programlisting>
    <para>Now, restart &CCL;.  This step is required because
      &CCL; cannot close and reload a dynamic library on OS
      X.</para>
    <para>Have you restarted?  Okay, try out the new code:</para>

      here's what happens if somebody mistakes
      <literal>sl_sl_test()</literal> for

    <para>Ouch.  The C function changes the value with no warning
      that something is wrong.  Even worse, it manages to pass the
      original value back to &CCL;, which hides the fact that
      something is wrong.</para>
    <para>Finally, let's take a look at doing this with
      floating-point numbers.</para>
    <programlisting>

      Welcome to &CCL; Version (Beta: Darwin) 0.14.2-040506!

      ? (open-shared-library "/Users/andewl/openmcl/libtypetest.dylib")

      Exited  d_d_test:
      -1.256791D+290
    </programlisting>
    <para>Notice that the number ends with "...e+11" for the single-float,
      and "...d+290" for the
      double-float.  Lisp has both of these float types itself, and the
      d instead of the e is how you specify which to create.  If
      you tried to pass :double-float 1.0e2 to external-call, Lisp would
      be nice enough to notice and give you a type error.  Don't get the
      :double-float wrong, though, because then there's no protection.</para>
    <para>Congratulations!  You now know how to call external C functions from
      within &CCL;, and pass numbers back and forth.  Now that the basic
      mechanics of calling and passing work, the next step is to examine how
      to pass more complex data structures around.</para>

  <sect1 id="Tutorial--Allocating-Foreign-Data-on-the-Lisp-Heap">
    <title>Tutorial: Allocating Foreign Data on the Lisp Heap </title>
    <para>Not every foreign function is so marvelously easy to use
      as the ones we saw in the last section.  Some of them require
      you to allocate a C struct, fill it in with your own
      information, and pass it a pointer to the struct.  Some of them
      require you to allocate an empty struct so they can fill it in,
      and then you can read the information out of it.</para>
    <para>Also, some of them have their own structs and return a
      pointer to that same struct every time you call them, but those
      are easier to deal with, so they won't be covered in this
      section.</para>
    <para>You might know that Lisp (and, indeed, most programming
      languages) has two separate regions of memory.  There's the
      stack, which is where variable bindings are kept.  Memory on the
      stack is allocated every time any function is called, and
      deallocated when it returns, so it's useful for anything that
      doesn't need to last longer than one function call, when there's
      only one thread.  If that's all you need, you can do it with
      .</para>
    <para>Then, there's the heap, which holds everything else, and
      is our subject here.  There are two advantages and one big
      disadvantage to putting things on the heap rather than the
      stack.  First, data allocated on the heap can be passed outside
      of the scope in which it was created.  This is useful for data
      which may need to be passed between multiple C calls or multiple
      threads. Also, some data may be too large to copy multiple times
      or may be too large to allocate on the stack.</para>
    <para>The second advantage is security.  If incoming data is
      being placed directly onto the stack, the input data can cause
      stack overflows and underflows.  This is not something which
      Lisp users generally worry about since garbage collection
      generally handles memory management.  However, "stack smashing"
      is one of the classic exploits in C which malicious hackers can
      use to gain control of a machine.  Not checking external data is
      always a bad idea; however, allocating it into the heap at least
      offers more protection than direct stack allocation.</para>
    <para>The big disadvantage to allocating data on the heap is
      that it must be explicitly deallocated&mdash;you need to "free" it
      when you're done with it.  Ordinarily, in Lisp, you wouldn't
      allocate memory yourself, and the garbage collector would know
      about it, so you wouldn't have to think about it again.  When
      you're doing it manually, it's very different.  Memory
      management becomes a manual process, just like in C and
      C++.</para>
    <para>What that means is that, if you allocate something and
      then lose track of the pointer to it, there's no way to ever
      free that memory.  That's what's called a memory leak, and if
      your program leaks enough memory it will eventually use up all
      of it!  So, you need to be careful to not lose your
      pointers.</para>
    <para>That disadvantage, though, is also an advantage for using
      foreign functions.  Since the garbage collector doesn't know
      about this memory, it will never move it around.  External C
      code needs this, because it doesn't know how to follow it to
      where it moved, the way that Lisp code does.  If you allocate
      data manually, you can pass it to foreign code and know that no
      matter what that code needs to do with it, it will be able to,
      until you deallocate it.  Of course, you'd better be sure it's
      done before you do.  Otherwise, your program will be unstable
      and might crash sometime in the future, and you'll have trouble
      figuring out what caused the trouble, because there won't be
      anything pointing back and saying "you deallocated this too
      soon."</para>
    <para>And, so, on to the code...</para>
    <para>As in the last tutorial, our first step
      is to create a local dynamic library in order to help show
      what is actually going on between &CCL; and C.  So, create the file
      ptrtest.c, with the following code:</para>
    <programlisting>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

void reverse_int_array(int * data, unsigned int dataobjs)
{
    int i, t;
    
    for(i=0; i&lt;dataobjs/2; i++)
        {
            t = *(data+i);
            *(data+i) = *(data+dataobjs-1-i);
            *(data+dataobjs-1-i) = t;
        }
}

void reverse_int_ptr_array(int **ptrs, unsigned int ptrobjs)
{
    int *t;
    int i;
    
    for(i=0; i&lt;ptrobjs/2; i++)
        {
            t = *(ptrs+i);
            *(ptrs+i) = *(ptrs+ptrobjs-1-i);
            *(ptrs+ptrobjs-1-i) = t;
        }
}

void
reverse_int_ptr_ptrtest(int **ptrs)
{
    reverse_int_ptr_array(ptrs, 2);
    
    reverse_int_array(*(ptrs+0), 4);
    reverse_int_array(*(ptrs+1), 4);
}
    </programlisting>
    <para>This defines three functions.
      <literal>reverse_int_array</literal> takes a pointer to an array
      of <literal>int</literal>s, and a count telling how many items
      are in the array, and loops through it putting the elements in
      reverse.  <literal>reverse_int_ptr_array</literal> does the same
      thing, but with an array of pointers to <literal>int</literal>s.
      It only reverses the order the pointers are in; each pointer
      still points to the same thing.
      <literal>reverse_int_ptr_ptrtest</literal> takes an array of
      pointers to arrays of <literal>int</literal>s.  (With me?)  It
      doesn't need to be told their sizes; it just assumes that the
      array of pointers has two items, and that both of those are
      arrays which have four items.  It reverses the array of
      pointers, then it reverses each of the two arrays of
      <literal>int</literal>s.</para>
    <para>Now, compile ptrtest.c into a dynamic library using the
      command:</para>
    <programlisting>
      gcc -dynamiclib -Wall -o libptrtest.dylib ptrtest.c -install_name ./libptrtest.dylib
    </programlisting>
    <para>If that command doesn't make sense to you, feel free to go back
      and read about it at .</para>
    <para>Now, start &CCL; and enter:</para>

    <para>If you don't understand how those functions do what they do.
      That's okay; it gets into very fine detail which really doesn't
      matter, because you don't need to change them.</para>
    <para>The function <literal>make-heap-ivector</literal> is the
      primary tool for allocating objects in heap memory.  It
      allocates a fixed-size &CCL; object in heap memory.  It
      returns both an array reference, which can be used directly from
      &CCL;, and a <literal>macptr</literal>, which can be used to
      access the underlying memory directly.  For example:</para>
    <programlisting>
      ? ;; Create an array of 3 4-byte-long integers
      (multiple-value-bind (la lap)
          (make-heap-ivector 3 '(unsigned-byte 32))
        (setq a la)
        (setq ap lap))

      #&lt;A Mac Pointer #x10217C>

      ? a
      #(1396 2578 97862649)

      ? ap
      #&lt;A Mac Pointer #x10217C>
    </programlisting>
    <para>It's important to realize that the contents of the
      <literal>ivector</literal> we've just created haven't been
      initialized, so their values are unpredictable, and you should
      be sure not to read from them before you set them, to avoid
      confusing results.</para>
    <para>At this point, <literal>a</literal> references an object
      which works just like a normal array.  You can refer to any item
      of it with the standard <literal>aref</literal> function, and
      set them by combining that with <literal>setf</literal>.  As
      noted above, the <literal>ivector</literal>'s contents haven't
      been initialized, so that's the next order of business:</para>
    <programlisting>
      ? a
      #(1396 2578 97862649)

      ? (aref a 2)
      97862649

      ? (setf (aref a 0) 3)
      3

      ? (setf (aref a 1) 4)
      4

      ? (setf (aref a 2) 5)
      5

      ? a
      #(3 4 5)
    </programlisting>
    <para>In addition, the <literal>macptr</literal> allows direct
      access to the same memory:</para>
    <programlisting>
      ? (setq *byte-length-of-long* 4)
      4

      ? (%get-signed-long ap (* 2 *byte-length-of-long*))
      5

      ? (%get-signed-long ap (* 0 *byte-length-of-long*))
      3

      ? (setf (%get-signed-long ap (* 0 *byte-length-of-long*)) 6)
      6

      ? (setf (%get-signed-long ap (* 2 *byte-length-of-long*)) 7)
      7

      ? ;; Show that a actually got changed through ap
      a
      #(6 4 7)
    </programlisting>
    <para>So far, there is nothing about this object that could not
      be done much better with standard Lisp.  However, the
      <literal>macptr</literal> can be used to pass this chunk of
      memory off to a C function.  Let's use the C code to reverse the
      elements in the array:</para>
    <programlisting>
      ? ;; Insert the full path to your copy of libptrtest.dylib
      (open-shared-library "/Users/andrewl/openmcl/openmcl/gtk/libptrtest.dylib")
      #&lt;SHLIB /Users/andrewl/openmcl/openmcl/gtk/libptrtest.dylib #x639D1E6>

      ? a
      #(6 4 7)

      ? ap
      #&lt;A Mac Pointer #x10217C>

      ? (external-call "_reverse_int_array" :address ap :unsigned-int (length a) :address)
      #&lt;A Mac Pointer #x10217C>

      ? a
      #(7 4 6)

      ? ap
      #&lt;A Mac Pointer #x10217C>
    </programlisting>
    <para>The array gets passed correctly to the C function,
      <literal>reverse_int_array</literal>.  The C function reverses
      the contents of the array in-place; that is, it doesn't make a
      new array, just keeps the same one and reverses what's in it.
      Finally, the C function passes control back to &CCL;.  Since
      the allocated array memory has been directly modified, &CCL;
      reflects those changes directly in the array as well.</para>
    <para>There is one final bit of housekeeping to deal with.
      Before moving on, the memory needs to be deallocated:</para>
    <programlisting>
      ? ;; dispose-heap-ivector created for symmetry
      ;; Macro repeated here for pedagogy
      (defmacro dispose-heap-ivector (a mp)
      `(progn
      (ccl::%dispose-heap-ivector ,a)
      ;; Demolish the arguments for safety
      (setf ,a nil)
      (setf ,mp nil)))
      DISPOSE-HEAP-IVECTOR

      ? (dispose-heap-ivector a ap)
      NIL

      ? a
      NIL

      ? ap
      NIL
    </programlisting>
    <para>The <literal>dispose-heap-ivector</literal> macro actually
      deallocates the ivector, releasing its memory into the heap for
      something else to use.  In addition, it makes sure that the
      variables which it was called with are set to nil, because
      otherwise they would still be referencing the memory of the
      ivector - which is no longer allocated, so that would be a bug.
      Making sure there are no other variables set to it is up to
      you.</para>
    <para>When do you call <literal>dispose-heap-ivector</literal>?
      Anytime after you know the ivector will never be used again, but
      no sooner.  If you have a lot of ivectors, say, in a hash table,
      you need to make sure that when whatever you were doing with the
      hash table is done, those ivectors all get freed.  Unless
      there's still something somewhere else which refers to them, of
      course!  Exactly what strategy to take depends on the situation,
      so just try to keep things simple unless you know better.</para>
    <para>The simplest situation is when you have things set up so
      that a Lisp object "encapsulates" a pointer to foreign data,
      taking care of all the details of using it.  In this case, you
      don't want those two things to have different lifetimes: You
      want to make sure your Lisp object exists as long as the foreign
      data does, and no longer; and you want to make sure the foreign
      data doesn't get deallocated while your Lisp object still refers
      to it.</para>
    <para>If you're willing to accept a few limitations, you can
      make this easy.  First, you can't let foreign code keep a
      permanent pointer to the memory; it has to always finish what
      it's doing, then return, and not refer to that memory again.
      Second, you can't let any Lisp code that isn't part of your
      encapsulating "wrapper" refer to the pointer directly.  Third,
      nothing, either foreign code or Lisp code, should explicitly
      deallocate the memory.</para>
    <para>If you can make sure all of these are true, you can at
      least ensure that the foreign pointer is deallocated when the
      encapsulating object is about to become garbage, by using
      &CCL;'s nonstandard "termination" mechanism, which is
      essentially the same as what Java and other languages call
      "finalization".</para>
    <para>Termination is a way of asking the garbage collector to
      let you know when it's about to destroy an object which isn't
      used anymore.  Before destroying the object, it calls a function
      which you write, called a terminator.</para>
    <para>So, you can use termination to find out when a particular
      <literal>macptr</literal> is about to become garbage.  That's
      not quite as helpful as it might seem: It's not exactly the same
      thing as knowing that the block of memory it points to is
      unreferenced.  For example, there could be another
      <literal>macptr</literal> somewhere to the same block; or, if
      it's a struct, there could be a <literal>macptr</literal> to one
      of its fields.  Most problematically, if the address of that
      memory has been passed to foreign code, it's sometimes hard to
      know whether that code has kept the pointer.  Most foreign
      functions don't, but it's not hard to think of
      exceptions.</para>
    <para>You can use code such as this to make all this happen:</para>
    <programlisting>
      (defclass wrapper (whatever)
        ((element-type :initarg :element-type)
         (element-count :initarg :element-count)
         (ivector)
         (macptr)))

      (defmethod initialize-instance ((wrapper wrapper) &rest; initargs)
        (declare (ignore initargs))
        (call-next-method)
        (ccl:terminate-when-unreachable wrapper)
        (with-slots (ivector macptr element-type element-count) wrapper
          (multiple-value-bind (new-ivector new-macptr)
              (make-heap-ivector element-count element-type)
            (setq ivector new-ivector
                  macptr new-macptr))))

      (defmethod ccl:terminate ((wrapper wrapper))
        (with-slots (ivector macptr) wrapper
          (when ivector
            (dispose-heap-ivector ivector macptr)
            (setq ivector nil
                  macptr nil))))
    </programlisting>
    <para>The <literal>ccl:terminate</literal> method will be called
      on some arbitrary thread sometime (hopefully soon) after the GC
      has decided that there are no strong references to an object
      which has been the argument of a
      <literal>ccl:terminate-when-unreachable</literal> call.</para>
    <para>If it makes sense to say that the foreign object should
      live as long as there's Lisp code that references it (through
      the encapsulating object) and no longer, this is one way of doing
      that.</para>
    <para>Now we've covered passing basic types back and forth with
      C, and we've done the same with pointers.  You may think this is
      all...  but we've only done pointers to basic types.  Join us
      next time for pointers... to pointers.</para>

	    <para>In &CCL; 1.2 and later, the #/ reader macro can be used to
	      access foreign functions on the Darwin platform. The current
	      behavior of the #/ reader macro is to:</para>

	    <para>Read a symbol from the current input stream, with
	      *PACKAGE* bound to the "NEXTSTEP-FUNCTIONS" package, with
	      readtable-case preserved, and with any colons included.</para>

        <para>Do limited sanity-checking on the resulting symbol; for
          example, any name that contains at least one colon is required
          also to end with a colon, to conform to Objective-C
          method-naming conventions.</para>

        <para>Export the resulting symbol from the "NEXTSTEP-FUNCTIONS"
          package and return it.</para>

        <para>For example, reading "#/alloc" interns and returns
          NEXTSTEP-FUNCTIONS:|alloc|. Reading "#/initWithFrame:" interns
          and returns NEXTSTEP-FUNCTIONS:|initWithFrame:|.</para>

        <para>A symbol read using this macro can be used as an operand
          in most places where an Objective-C message name can be used, such as
          in the (OBJ:@SELECTOR ...) construct.</para>

        <para>Please note: the reader macro is not rigorous about
          enforcing Objective-C method-naming conventions. Despite the
          simple checking done by the reader macro, it may still be
          possible to use it to construct invalid names.</para>

        <para>The act of interning a new symbol in the
          NEXTSTEP-FUNCTIONS package triggers an interface database lookup
          of Objective-C methods with the corresponding message name.  If any
          such information is found, a special type of dispatching
          function is created and initialized and the new symbol is given
          the newly-created dispatching function as its function
          definition.</para>

        <para>The dispatching knows how to call declared Objective-C methods
          defined on the message. In many cases, all methods have the same
          foreign type signature, and the dispatching function merely
          passes any arguments that it receives to a function that does an
          Objective-C message send with the indicated foreign argument and return
          types. In other cases, where different Objective-C messages have
          different type signatures, the dispatching function tries to
          choose a function that handles the right type signature based on
          the class of the dispatching function's first argument.</para>
	    
        <para>If new information about Objective-C methods is introduced
          (e.g., by using additional interface files or as Objective-C
          methods are defined from lisp), the dispatch function is
          reinitialized to recognize newly-introduced foreign type
          signatures.</para>

        <para>The argument and result coercion that the bridge has
          traditionally supported is supported by the new mechanism (e.g.,
          :&lt;BOOL&gt; arguments can be specified as lisp booleans and :&lt;BOOL&gt;
          results are returned as lisp boolean values, and an argument
          value of NIL is coerced to a null pointer if the corresponding
          argument type is :ID.</para>

        <para>Some Objective-C methods accept variable numbers of
          arguments; the foreign types of non-required arguments are
          determined by the lisp types of those arguments (e.g., integers
          are passed as integers, floats as floats, pointers as pointers,
          record types by reference.)</para>

        <para>Examples:</para>

        <programlisting>
          ;;; #/alloc is a known message.
          ? #'#/alloc
          #&lt;OBJC-DISPATCH-FUNCTION NEXTSTEP-FUNCTIONS:|alloc| #x300040E94EBF&gt;
          ;;; Sadly, #/foo is not ...
          ? #'#/foo
          &gt; Error: Undefined function: NEXTSTEP-FUNCTIONS:|foo|

          ;;; We can send an "init" message to a newly-allocated instance of
          ;;; "NSObject" by:

          (send (send ns:ns-object 'alloc) 'init)

          ;;; or by

          (#/init (#/alloc ns:ns-object))
        </programlisting>

        <para>Objective-C methods that "return" structures return them
          as garbage-collectable pointers when called via dispatch
          functions.  For example, if "my-window" is an NS:NS-WINDOW
          instance, then</para>

        <programlisting>
          (#/frame my-window)
        </programlisting>

        <para>returns a garbage-collectable pointer to a structure that
          describes that window's frame rectangle. This convention means
          that there's no need to use SLET or special structure-returning
          message send syntax; keep in mind, though, that #_malloc,
          #_free, and the GC are all involved in the creation and eventual
          destruction of structure-typed return values. In some programs
          these operations may have an impact on performance.</para>

	    <para>
	      Allocates a block of foreign memory suitable to hold the foreign
	      type described by <code>typespec</code>, in the same manner
	      as <link linkend="anchor_make-record">MAKE-RECORD</link>. In
	      addition, <code>MAKE-GCABLE-RECORD</code> marks the
	      returned object gcable; in other words, it informs the garbage
	      collector that it may reclaim the object when it becomes
	      unreachable.
	    </para>

        <para>In all other respects, <code>MAKE-GCABLE-RECORD</code> works
          the same way
          as <link linkend="anchor_make-record">MAKE-RECORD</link></para>

        <para> When using gcable pointers, it's important to remember the
          distinction between a <code>MACPTR</code> object (which is a
          lisp object, more or less like any other) and the block of
          foreign memory that the <code>MACPTR</code> object points to.
          If a gcable <code>MACPTR</code> object is the only thing in the
          world (lisp world or foreign world) that references the
          underlying block of foreign memory, then freeing the foreign
          memory when it becomes impossible to reference it is convenient
          and sane.  If other lisp <code>MACPTR</code>s reference the
          underlying block of foreign memory or if the address of that
          foreign memory is passed to and retained by foreign code, having
          the GC free the memory may have unpleasant consequences if those
          other references are used.</para>

        <para>Take care, therefore, not to create a gcable record unless
          you are sure that the returned <code>MACPTR</code> will be the
          only reference to the allocated memory that will ever be
          used.</para>

	      Expands into code which allocates and initializes
	      an instance of the type 
	      denoted by <varname>typespec</varname>, on the foreign
	      heap.  The record is allocated using the C function
	      <function>malloc</function>, and the user of
	      <function>make-record</function> must explicitly call
	      the function <function>CCL:FREE</function> to deallocate the
	      record, when it is no longer needed.
	    </para>

	    <para>
	      If <varname>initforms</varname> is provided, its value
	      or values are used in the initialization.  When the type
	      is a scalar, <varname>initforms</varname> is either a single
	      value which can be coerced to that type, or no value, in which
	      case binary 0 is used.  When the type is a <type>struct</type>,
	      <varname>initforms</varname> is a list, giving field names
	      and the values for each.  Each field is treated in the same way
	      as a scalar is: If a value for it is given, it must be
	      coerceable to the field's type; if not, binary 0 is used.
	    </para>

	    <para>
	      When the type is an array, <varname>initforms</varname> may
	      not be provided, because <function>make-record</function>
	      cannot initialize its values.  <function>make-record</function>
	      is also unable to initialize fields of a <type>struct</type>
	      which are themselves
	      <type>struct</type>s.  The user of
	      <function>make-record</function> should set these values
	      by another means.
	    </para>

	    <para>
	      A possibly-significant limitation is that it must be possible to
	      find the foreign type at the time the macro is expanded;
	      <function>make-record</function> signals an error if this is
	      not the case.
	    </para>
	  </refsect1>

	  <refsect1>
	    <title>Notes</title>

	    <para>
	      It is inconvenient that <function>make-record</function> is a
	      macro, because this means that <varname>typespec</varname>
	      cannot be a variable; it must be an immediate value.
	    </para>
	    
	    <para>
	      If it weren't for this requirement,
	      <function>make-record</function> could be a function.  However,
	      that would mean that any stand-alone application using it would
	      have to include a copy of the interface database
	      (see <xref linkend="The-Interface-Database"/>), which is undesirable
	      because it's large.

	    <title>Description</title>

	    <para>
	      The "termination" mechanism is a way to have the garbage
	      collector run a function right before an object is about to
	      become garbage.  It is very similar to the "finalization"
	      mechanism which Java has.  It is not standard Common Lisp,
	      although other Lisp implementations have similar features.
	      It is useful when there is some sort of special cleanup,
	      deallocation, or releasing of resources which needs to happen
	      when a certain object is no longer being used.
	    </para>

	    <para>
	      When the garbage collector discovers that an object is no
	      longer referred to anywhere in the program, it deallocates
	      that object, freeing its memory.  However, if
	      <function>ccl:terminate-when-unreachable</function> has been
	      called on the object at any time, the garbage collector first
	      invokes the generic function <function>ccl:terminate</function>,
	      passing it the object as a parameter.
	    </para>

	    <para>
	      Therefore, to make termination do something useful, you need to
	      define a method on <function>ccl:terminate</function>.
	    </para>

	    <para>
	      Because calling
	      <function>ccl:terminate-when-unreachable</function> only
	      affects a single object, rather than all objects of its
	      class, you
	      may wish to put a call to it in the
	      <function>initialize-instance</function> method of a
	      class.  Of course, this is only appropriate if you do in fact
	      want to use termination for all objects of a given class.

	    <para>Note that <function>use-interface-dir</function>

	      If the named directory doesn&#39;t exist in the file system

	      contain a set of database files, a runtime error may occur
	      when &CCL;
	      tries to open some database file in that directory, and it
	      will try to

	    <title>Examples</title>

	    <para>One typically wants interface information to be

	      A typical idiom would be:</para>

	    <programlisting format="linespecific">(eval-when (:compile-toplevel :execute)
          (use-interface-dir :GTK))</programlisting>

	    <para>Using the :GTK interface directory makes available
	      information on
	      foreign types, functions, and constants.  It's generally
	      necessary to
	      load foreign libraries before actually calling the
	      foreign code, which for GTK can be done like this:</para>

	    <programlisting>(load-gtk-libraries)</programlisting>

	    <para>It should now be possible to do things like:</para>

	    <programlisting>(#_gtk_widget_destroy w)</programlisting>
