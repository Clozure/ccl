    <title>Using the Linux oprofile system-level profiler</title>

    <para><ulink
    url="http://oprofile.sourceforge.net"><code>oprofile</code></ulink> is a
    system-level profiler that's available for most modern Linux
    distributions.</para>

    <para>Use of oprofile and its companion programs isn't really documented
    here; what is described is a way of generating symbolic information that
    enables profiling summaries generated by the <code>opreport</code> program
    to identify lisp functions meaningfully.</para>

    <sect2 id="Profiling-oprofile-generating-a-lisp-image-for-use-with-oprofile">
      <title>Generating a lisp image for use with oprofile</title>

      <para>Modern Linux uses the 'ELF" (Executable and Linking Format) object
      file format; the oprofile tools can associate symbolic names with
      addresses in a memory-mapped file if that file appears to be an ELF
      object file and if it contains ELF symbol information that describes
      those memory regions. So, the general idea is to make a lisp heap image
      that looks enough like an ELF shared library to fool the
      <code>oprofile</code> tools (we don't actually load heap images via ELF
      dynamic linking technology, but we can make it look like we did.)</para>

          implementations in widespread use on Linux, and different
          distributions refer to them by different names (they may be
          available as part of an 'elfutils' package.) The oprofile insterface
          was designed to work with a libelf implementation whose version
          number is currently around 147; the other (incompatible) libelf
          implementation has a version number around 0.8. It may be necessary
          to install the corresponding development package (-dev or -devel,
          usuallly) in order to actually be able to use the libelf shared
          library.</para>

    <title>Using Apple's CHUD metering tools</title>

    <para>Apple's CHUD package provides libraries, kernel extensions, and a
    set of graphical and command-line programs that can be used to measure
    many aspects of application and system performance.</para>

    <para>One of these programs is the Shark application (often installed in
    "/Developer/Applications/Performance Tools/Shark.app"), which provides a
    graphical user interface for exploring and analyzing profiling results and
    provides tools for creating "sampling configurations" (see below), among
    other things. Use of Shark isn't really documented here (a Shark manual is
    available at "Developer/Documentation/CHUD/Shark/ SharkUserGuide.pdf");
    what is described is a way of providing information about Lisp function
    names and addresses so that Shark can meaningly identify those functions
    in its output.</para>

      <title>Prerequisites</title>

      <para>Apple's CHUD tools have been distributed with the last several
      XCode releases. One way to determine whether or not the tools are
      installed is to run:</para>

      <programlisting>$ /usr/bin/shark -v</programlisting>

    <sect2>
      <title>Generating a lisp image for use with Shark</title>

      <para>Shark can only properly identify functions that're defined in a
      shared library that's loaded by the target application. (Any other
      functions will be identified by a hex address described as being in an
      "Unknown Library"; the hex address is generally somewhat near the actual
      function, but it's determined heuristically and isn't always
      accurate.)</para>

      <para>For those reasons, it's desirable to load the code that you wish
      to profile in one lisp session, save a native (Mach-O library) image,
      and invoke Shark in a new session which uses that native image. (It may
      also be useful to load the CHUD-METERING module, which defines
      CHUD:METER and friends.</para>
