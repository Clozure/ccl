      <title>Overview</title>
      <para> The documentation and whatever experience you may have in
      using &CCL; under Linux should also apply to using it under
      Darwin/MacOS X and FreeBSD. There are some differences between
      the platforms, and these differences are sometimes exposed in
      the implementation.</para>


      <sect2 id="File-system-case">
	<title>File-system case</title>

	<para>Darwin and MacOS X use HFS+ file systems by default;
	HFS+ file systems are usually case-insensitive. Most of
	&CCL;'s filesystem and pathname code assumes that the
	underlying filesystem is case-sensitive; this assumption
	extends to functions like EQUAL, which assumes that #p"FOO"
	and #p"foo" denote different, un-EQUAL filenames. Since
	Darwin/MacOS X can also use UFS and NFS filesystems, the
	opposite assumption would be no more correct than the one
	that's currently made.</para>
        <para>Whatever the best solution to this problem turns out to be, there are
some practical considerations. Doing:</para>
        <programlisting>
? (save-application "DPPCCL")
	</programlisting>
        <para>on 32-bit DarwinPPC has the unfortunate side-effect of
        trying to overwrite the Darwin &CCL; kernel, "dppccl", on a
        case-insensitive filesystem.</para>
        <para>To work around this, the Darwin &CCL; kernel expects
        the default heap image file name to be the kernel's own
        filename with the string ".image" appended, so the idiom would
        be:</para>
        <programlisting>
? (save-application "dppccl.image")
	</programlisting>
      </sect2>

      <sect2 id="Line-Termination-Characters">
	<title>Line Termination Characters</title>
        <para>MacOSX effectively supports two distinct line-termination
	conventions. Programs in its Darwin substrate follow the Unix
	convention of recognizing #\LineFeed as a line terminator; traditional
	MacOS programs use #\Return for this purpose.  Many modern
	GUI programs try to support several different line-termination
	conventions (on the theory that the user shouldn't be too concerned
	about what conventions are used an that it probably doesn't matter.
	Sometimes this is true, other times ... not so much.
	</para>
        <para>&CCL; follows the Unix convention on both Darwin and
        LinuxPPC, but offers some support for reading and writing
        files that use other conventions (including traditional MacOS
        conventions) as well.</para> 
	<para>This support (and anything like it) is by nature
	heuristic: it can successfully hide the distinction between
	newline conventions much of the time, but could mistakenly
	change the meaning of otherwise correct programs (typically
	when files contain both #\Return and #\Linefeed characters or
	when files contain mixtures of text and binary data.) Because
	of this concern, the default settings of some of the variables
	that control newline translation and interpretation are
	somewhat conservative.</para>
	<para>Although the issue of multiple newline conventions
	primarily affects MacOSX users, the functionality described
	here is available under LinuxPPC as well (and may occasionally
	be useful there.)</para> <para>None of this addresses issues
	related to the third newline convention ("CRLF") in widespread
	use (since that convention isn't native to any platform on
	which &CCL; currently runs). If &CCL; is ever ported to
	such a platform, that issue might be revisited.</para>
	<para>Note that some MacOS programs (including some versions
	of commercial MCL) may use HFS file type information to
	recognize TEXT and other file types and so may fail to
	recognize files created with &CCL; or other Darwin
	applications (regardless of line termination issues.)</para>
	<para>Unless otherwise noted, the symbols mentioned in this
	documentation are exported from the CCL package.</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2 id="Single-precision-trig---transcendental-functions">
	<title>Single-precision trig &amp; transcendental functions</title>
        <para>
	Despite what Darwin's man pages say, early versions of its math library
	(up to and including at least OSX 10.2 (Jaguar) don't implement
	single-precision variants of the transcendental and trig functions
	(#_sinf, #_atanf, etc.) &CCL; worked around this by coercing
	single-precision args to double-precision, calling the
	double-precision version of the math library function, and coercing
	the result back to a SINGLE-FLOAT. These steps can introduce rounding
	errors (and potentially overflow conditions) that might not be present
	or as severe if true 32-bit variants were available.</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2 id="Shared-libraries">
	<title>Shared libraries</title>
        <para>Darwin/MacOS X distinguishes between "shared libraries"
        and "bundles" or "extensions"; Linux and FreeBSD don't. In
        Darwin, "shared libraries" have the file type "dylib" : the
        expectation is that this class of file is linked against when
        executable files are created and loaded by the OS when the
        executable is launched. The latter class -
        "bundles/extensions" - are expected to be loaded into and
        unloaded from a running application, via a mechanism like the
        one used by &CCL;'s OPEN-SHARED-LIBRARY function.</para>
      </sect2>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="Unix-Posix-Darwin-Features">
      <title>Unix/Posix/Darwin Features</title>
      <para>&CCL; has several convenience functions which allow you
      to make Posix (portable Unix) calls without having to use the
      foreign-function interface.  Each of these corresponds directly
      to a single Posix function call, as it might be made in C.
      There is no attempt to make these calls correspond to Lisp
      idioms, such as <literal>setf</literal>.  This means that their
      behaviour is simple and predictable.</para>
      <para>For working with environment variables, there are
      CCL::GETENV and CCL::SETENV.</para>
      <para>For working with user and group IDs, there are
      CCL::GETUID, CCL::SETUID, and CCL::SETGID.  To find the home
      directory of an arbitrary user, as set in the user database
      (/etc/passwd), there is CCL::GET-USER-HOME-DIR.</para>
      <para>For process IDs, there is CCL::GETPID.</para>
      <para>For the <literal>system()</literal> function, there is
      CCL::OS-COMMAND.  Ordinarily, it is better - both more efficient
      and more predictable - to use the features described in <xref
      linkend="Running-Other-Programs-as-Subprocesses"/>.  However,
      sometimes you may want to specifically ask the shell to invoke a
      command for you.</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="Cocoa-Programming-in-CCL">
      <title>Cocoa Programming in &CCL;</title>
      <para>Cocoa is one of Apple's APIs for GUI programming; for most
      purposes, development is considerably faster with Cocoa than
      with the alternatives.  You should have a little familiarity
      with it, to better understand this section.</para>
      <para>A small sample Cocoa program can be invoked by evaluating
      (REQUIRE 'TINY) and then (CCL::TINY-SETUP). This program
      provides a simple example of using several of the bridge's
      capabilities.</para>
      <para>The Tiny demo creates Cocoa objects dynamically, at
      runtime, which is always an option.  However, for large
      applications, it is usually more convenient to create your
      objects with Apple Interface Builder, and store them in .nib
      files to be loaded when needed.  Both approaches can be freely
      mixed in a single program.</para>

      <sect2 id="The-Command-Line-and-the-Window-System">
	<title>The Command Line and the Window System</title>
        <para>&CCL; is ordinarily a command-line application (it
        doesn't have a connection to the OSX Window server, doesn't
        have its own menubar or dock icon, etc.) By opening some
        libraries and jumping through some hoops, it's able to sort of
        transform itself into a full-fledged GUI application (while
        retaining its original TTY-based listener.) The general idea
        is that this hybrid environment can be used to test and
        protoype UI ideas and the resulting application can eventually
        be fully transformed into a bundled, double-clickable
        application. This is to some degree possible, but there needs
        to be a bit more infrastructure in place before many people
        would find it easy.</para>
        <para>Cocoa applications use the NSLog function to write
        informational/warning/error messages to the application's
        standard output stream. When launched by the Finder, a GUI
        application's standard output is diverted to a logging
        facility that can be monitored with the Console application
        (found in /Applications/Utilities/Console.app).  In the hybrid
        environment, the application's standard output stream is
        usually the initial listener's standard output stream. With
        two different buffered stream mechanisms trying to write to
        the same underlying Unix file descriptor, it's not uncommon to
        see NSLog output mixed with lisp output on the initial
        listener.</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2 id="Writing--and-reading--Cocoa-code">
	<title>Writing (and reading) Cocoa code</title> <para>The
	syntax of the constructs used to define Cocoa classes and
	methods has changed a bit (it was never documented outside of
	the source code and never too well documented at all), largely
	as the result of functionality offered by Randall Beer's
	bridge; the &ldquo;standard name-mapping conventions&rdquo;
	referenced below are described in his CocoaBridgeDoc.txt file,
	as are the constructs used to invoke (&ldquo;send messages
	to&rdquo;) Cocoa methods.</para>

      <sect2 id="The-Application-Kit-and-Multiple-Threads">
	<title>The Application Kit and Multiple Threads</title>
        <para>The Cocoa API is broken into several pieces.  The
        Application Kit, affectionately called AppKit, is the one
        which deals with window management, drawing, and handling
        events.  AppKit really wants all these things to be done by a
        "distinguished thread".  creation, and drawing to take place
        on a distinguished thread.</para>
        <para>Apple has published some guidelines which discuss these
        issues in some detail; see the Apple Multithreading
        Documentation, and in particular the guidelines on Using the
        Application Kit from Multiple Threads.  The upshot is that
        there can sometimes be unexpected behavior when objects are
        created in threads other than the distinguished event thread;
        eg, the event thread sometimes starts performing operations on
        objects that haven't been fully initialized.</para> <para>It's
        certainly more convenient to do certain types of exploratory
        programming by typing things into a listener or evaluating a
        &ldquo;defun&rdquo; in an Emacs buffer; it may sometimes be
        necessary to be aware of this issue while doing so.</para>
        <para>Each thread in the Cocoa runtime system is expected to
        maintain a current &ldquo;autorelease pool&rdquo; (an instance
        of the NSAutoreleasePool class); newly created objects are
        often added to the current autorelease pool (via the
        -autorelease method), and periodically the current autorelease
        pool is sent a &ldquo;-release&rdquo; message, which causes it
        to send &ldquo;-release&rdquo; messages to all of the objects
        that've been added to it.</para>
        <para>If the current thread doesn't have a current autorelease
        pool, the attempt to autorelease any object will result in a
        severe-looking warning being written via NSLog. The event
        thread maintains an autorelease pool (it releases the current
        pool after each event is processed and creates a new one for
        the next event), so code that only runs in that thread should
        never provoke any of these severe-looking NSLog
        messages.</para> <para>To try to suppress these messages (and
        still participate in the Cocoa memory management scheme), each
        listener thread (the initial listener and any created via the
        &ldquo;New Listener&rdquo; command in the IDE) is given a
        default autorelease pool; there are REPL colon-commands for
        manipulating the current listener's &ldquo;toplevel
        auturelease pool&rdquo;.</para>
        <para>In the current scheme, every time that Cocoa calls lisp
        code, a lisp error handler is established which maps any lisp
        conditions to ObjC exceptions and arranges that this exception
        is raised when the callback to lisp returns. Whenever lisp
        code invokes a Cocoa method, it does so with an ObjC exception
        handler in place; this handler maps ObjC exceptions to lisp
        conditions and signals those conditions.</para> <para>Any
        unhandled lisp error or ObjC exception that occurs during the
        execution of the distinguished event thread's event loop
        causes a message to be NSLog'ed and the event loop to (try to)
        continue execution. Any error that occurs in other threads is
        handled at the point of the outermost Cocoa method
        invocation. (Note that the error is not necessarily
        &ldquo;handled&rdquo; in the dynamic context in which it
        occurs.)</para>
        <para>Both of these behaviors could possibly be improved; both of them
seem to be substantial improvements over previous behaviors (where,
for instance, a misspelled message name typically terminated the
application.)</para>

    <sect1 id="Building-an-Application-Bundle">
      <title>Building an Application Bundle</title>
      <para>You may have noticed that (require "COCOA") takes a long
      time to load.  It is possible to avoid this by saving a Lisp
      heap image which has everything already loaded.  There is an
      example file which allows you to do this,
      "ccl/examples/cocoa-application.lisp", by producing a
      double-clickable application which runs your program.  First,
      load your own program.  Then, do:</para>
      <programlisting>
? (require "COCOA-APPLICATION")
      </programlisting>
      <para>When it finishes, you should be able to double-click the &CCL; icon
in the ccl directory, to quickly start your program.</para>
      <para>The OS may have already decided that &CCL;.app isn't a valid
executable bundle, and therefore won't let you double-click it.
If this happens to you, to force it to reconsider, just update the
last-modified time of the bundle.  In Terminal:</para>
      <programlisting>> touch &CCL;.app
</programlisting>
      <para>There is one important caveat.</para>
      <para>Because of the way that the ObjC bridge currently works, a saved
image is dependent upon the <emphasis>exact</emphasis> versions of
the Cocoa libraries which were present when it was saved.
Specifically, the interface database is.  So, for example, an
application produced under OS X 10.3.5 will not work under
OS X 10.3.6.  This is inconvenient when you wish to distribute an
application you have built this way.</para>
      <para>Work in this direction is ongoing.  It is worth looking at the project
"Bosco", by Mikel Evins, which is a template that can be used to build
application bundles in a different way.  It is
available here, as part
of the "Clotho" project, and there is
here.</para>
      <para>When an image which had contained ObjC classes (which are also
CLOS classes) is re-launched, those classes are "revived": all
preexisting classes have their addresses updated destructively, so that
existing subclass/superclass/metaclass relationships are maintained.
It's not possible (and may never be) to preserve foreign
instances across SAVE-APPLICATION. (It may be the case that NSArchiver
and NSCoder and related classes offer some approximation of that.)</para>

	    <title>Description</title>

	    <para>Per ANSI CL, &CCL; supports the :EXTERNAL-FORMAT keyword
	    argument to the functions OPEN, LOAD, and COMPILE-FILE. This argument is
	    intended to provide a standard way of providing implementation-dependent
	    information about the format of files opened with an element-type of
	    CHARACTER. This argument can meaningfully take on the values :DEFAULT
	    (the default), :MACOS, :UNIX, or :INFERRED in &CCL;.</para>
	    
	    <para>When defaulted to or specified as :DEFAULT, the format of the file
	    stream is determined by the value of the variable
	    CCL:*DEFAULT-EXTERNAL-FORMAT*. See below.</para>
	    
	    <para>When specified as :UNIX, all characters are read from and written
	    to files verbatim.</para>
	    
	    <para>When specified as :MACOS, all #\Return characters read from the
	    file are immediately translated to #\Linefeed (#\Newline); all #\Newline
	    (#\Linefeed) characters are written externally as #\Return characters.</para>
	    
	    <para>When specified as :INFERRED and the file is open for input, the
	    first bufferful of input data is examined; if a #\Return character
	    appears in the buffer before the first #\Linefeed, the file stream&#39;s
	    external-format is set to :MACOS; otherwise, it is set to :UNIX.</para>
	    
	    <para>All other values of :EXTERNAL-FORMAT - and any combinations that
	    don&#39;t make sense, such as trying to infer the format of a
	    newly-created output file stream - are treated as if :UNIX was
	    specified. As mentioned above, the :EXTERNAL-FORMAT argument doesn&#39;t
	    apply to binary file streams.</para>
	    
	    <para>The translation performed when :MACOS is specified or inferred has
	    a somewhat greater chance of doing the right thing than the
	    *alternate-line-terminator* mechanism does; it probably has a somewhat
	    greater chance of doing the wrong thing, as well.</para>

	    could have undesirable consequences, the initial value of this variable
	    in &CCL; is :UNIX.</para>

	    <para>
	      The string itself is stored on the Lisp heap, which
	      means that its memory management is automatic.  However, the
	      ns-lisp-string object itself is a foreign
	      object (that is, it has an objc metaclass), and resides on the
	      foreign heap.  Therefore, it is necessary to explicitly free
	      it, by sending a dealloc message.

	      Currently, ns-lisp-string is defined in
	      the file ccl/examples/cocoa-backtrace.lisp, which is a
	      rather awkward place.  It was probably not originally meant
	      as a public utility at all.  It would be good if it were
	      moved someplace else.  Use at your own risk.
