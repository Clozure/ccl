      <para>Gray streams (see <xref

      all inherit from <literal>FUNDAMENTAL-STREAM</literal> whereas
      basic streams inherit from <literal>CCL::BASIC-STREAM</literal>.
      The tradeoff between FUNDAMENTAL and BASIC streams is entirely
      between flexibility and performance, potential or actual.  I/O
      primitives can recognize BASIC-STREAMs and exploit knowledge of
      implementation details. FUNDAMENTAL stream classes can be
      subclassed and extended in a standard way (the Gray streams
      protocol).</para>

      <para>For existing stream classes (FILE-STREAMs, SOCKETs, and
      the internal CCL::FD-STREAM classes used to implement file
      streams and sockets), a lot of code can be shared between the
      FUNDAMENTAL and BASIC implementations.  The biggest difference
      should be that that code can be reached from I/O primitives like
      READ-CHAR without going through some steps that're there to
      support generality and extensibility, and skipping those steps
      when that support isn't needed can improve I/O performance.
      </para>

      <para>The Gray stream method
      <function>STREAM-READ-CHAR</function> should work on appropriate
      <literal>BASIC-STREAM</literal>s.  (There may still be cases
      where such methods are undefined; such cases should be
      considered bugs.)  It is not guaranteed that Gray stream methods
      would ever be called by I/O primitives to read a character from
      a <literal>BASIC-STREAM</literal>, though there are still cases
      where this happens.</para>

      <para>A simple loop reading 2M characters from a text file runs
      about 10X faster when the file is opened the new defaults
      <literal>(:SHARING :PRIVATE :BASIC T)</literal> than it had
      before these changes were made.  That sounds good, until one
      realizes that the "equivalent" C loop can be about 10X faster
      still ...</para>

        <function>STREAM-OUTPUT-TIMEOUT</function> are specified in
        seconds and can be any positive real number less than one million.
        When a timeout is set and the corresponding I/O operation takes
        longer than the specified interval, an error is signalled.  The
        error is <literal>INPUT-TIMEOUT</literal> for input and
        <literal>OUTPUT-TIMEOUT</literal> for output.
        <literal>STREAM-DEADLINE</literal> specifies an absolute time in
        internal-time-units.  If an I/O operation on the stream does not
        complete before the deadline then a

      <para>This sect1 is still being written and revised, because
        it is woefully incomplete.  The dictionary section currently
        only lists a couple functions.  Caveat lector.</para>
      <para>Gray streams are an extension to Common Lisp.  They were
        proposed for standardization by David Gray (the astute reader
        now understands their name) quite some years ago, but not
        accepted, because they had not been tried sufficiently to find
        conceptual problems with them.</para>
      <para>They have since been implemented by quite a few modern
        Lisp implementations.  However, they do indeed have some
        inadequacies, and each implementation has addressed these in
        different ways.  The situation today is that it's difficult to
        even find out how to get started using Gray streams.  This is
        why standards are important.</para>
      <para>Here's a list of some classes which you might wish for
        your new stream class to inherit from:</para>

      <para>All of these are defined in ccl/level-1/l1-streams.lisp,
        except for the ccl:file-* ones, which are in
        ccl/level-1/l1-sysio.lisp.</para>
      <para>According to the original Gray streams proposal, you
        should inherit from the most specific of the fundamental-*
        classes which applies.  Using &CCL;, though, if you want
        buffering for better performance, which, unless you know of some
        reason you wouldn't, you do, you should instead inherit from the
        appropriate ccl::buffered-* class The buffering you get this way
        is exactly the same as the buffering which is used on ordinary,
        non-Gray streams, and force-output will work properly on
        it.</para>
      <para>Notice that -mixin suffix in the names of all the
        ccl::buffered-* classes?  The suffix means that this class is
        not "complete" by itself; you still need to inherit from a
        fundamental-* stream, even if you also inherit from a *-mixin
        stream.  You might consider making your own class like this.
        ....  Except that they do inherit from the fundamental-*
        streams, that's weird.</para>
      <para>If you want to be able to create an instance of your class
        with the :class argument to (open) and (with-open-file), you
        should make it inherit from one of the file-* classes.  If you
        do this, it's not necessary to inherit from any of the other
        classes (though it won't hurt anything), since the file-*
        classes already do.</para>
      <para>When you inherit from the file-* classes, you can use
        (call-next-method) in any of your methods to get the standard
        behavior.  This is especially useful if you want to create a
        class which performs some simple filtering operation, such as
        changing everything to uppercase or to a different character
        encoding.  If you do this, you will definitely need to
        specialize ccl::select-stream-class.  Your method on
        ccl::stream-select-class should accept an instance of the class,
        but pay no attention to its contents, and return a symbol naming
        the class to actually be instantiated.</para>
      <para>If you need to make your functionality generic across all
        the different types of stream, probably the best way to
        implement it is to make it a mixin, define classes with all the
        variants of input, output, io, character, and binary, which
        inherit both from your mixin and from the appropriate other
        class, then define a method on ccl::select-stream-class which
        chooses from among those classes.</para>
      <para>Note that some of these classes are internal to the CCL
        package.  If you try to inherit from those ones without the
        ccl:: prefix, you'll get an error which may confuse you, calling
        them "forward-referenced classes".  That just means you used the
        wrong symbol, so add the prefix.</para>
      <para>Here's a list of some generic functions which you might
        wish to specialize for your new stream class, and which ought to
        be documented at some point.</para>

	    <title>Overview</title>
	    <para>The "Gray Streams" API is based on an informal proposal that was
	      made before ANSI CL adopted the READ-SEQUENCE and WRITE-SEQUENCE
	      functions; as such, there is no "standard" way for the author of a Gray
	      stream class to improve the performance of these functions by exploiting
	      knowledge of the stream's internals (e.g., the buffering mechanism it
	      uses.)</para>
	    <para>In the absence of any such knowledge, READ-SEQUENCE and
	      WRITE-SEQUENCE are effectively just convenient shorthand for a
	      loop which calls READ-CHAR/READ-BYTE/WRITE-CHAR/WRITE-BYTE as
	      appropriate. The mechanism described below allows subclasses
	      of FUNDAMENTAL-STREAM to define more specialized (and
	      presumably more efficient) behavior.</para>

	    <para>READ-SEQUENCE and WRITE-SEQUENCE do a certain amount of

	      can be used to handle the general case.</para>

      <para>All heap-allocated objects in &CCL; that cannot contain

        READ-SEQUENCE and WRITE-SEQUENCE functions.</para>
      <para>As used here, the term "octet" means roughly the same
        thing as the term "8-bit byte". The functions described below
        transfer a specified sequence of octets between a buffered
        stream and an ivector, and don't really concern themselves with
        higher-level issues (like whether that octet sequence is within
        bounds or how it relates to the logical contents of the
        ivector.) For these reasons, these functions are generally less
        safe and more flexible than their ANSI counterparts.</para>

    <title>Lisp Standard Streams and OS Standard Streams</title>
    <para>
      In normal interactive usage, the input and output sides of the
      bidirectional stream <literal>*terminal-io*</literal> are hooked
      up to the the operating system's standard input and standard
      output.  The lisp streams <literal>*standard-input*</literal>,
      <literal>*standard-output*</literal>, and
      <literal>*error-output*</literal> are synonym streams for
      <literal>*terminal-io*</literal>.
    </para>
    <para>
      In batch mode, this arrangement is modified slightly.  The lisp
      streams <literal>*standard-input*</literal>,
      <literal>*standard-output*</literal>, and
      <literal>*standard-error*</literal> correspond directly to the
      operating system's standard input, standard output, and standard
      error.  If the lisp can determine that it has access to an
      operating system tty, then <literal>*terminal-io*</literal> will
      be hooked up to that.  Otherwise, the input and output streams
      of <literal>*terminal-io*</literal> will correspond to the
      operating system's standard input and standard output.
